Problem Statement

Build a machine learning model to predict whether the shipment will arrive on time or not. ( column ‘Reached.on.Time_Y.N’ from the attached data needs to be predicted ) 
You can consider that shipment which would arrive late is a higher risk for business.

Metadata

ID: Unique identifier for each shipment.
Warehouse_block: The block from which the product was shipped.
Mode_of_Shipment: The mode of shipment (e.g., Flight, Ship, Road).
Customer_care_calls: Number of calls made by the customer.
Customer_rating: Rating given by the customer (1 to 5).
Cost_of_the_Product: Cost of the product being shipped.
Prior_purchases: Number of prior purchases made by the customer.
Product_importance: Importance of the product (low, medium, high).
Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).
Discount_offered: Discount offered on the product.
Weight_in_gms: Weight of the product in grams.
Reached.on.Time_Y.N: Whether the shipment reached on time (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

Devlop a machine learning pipeline:
- EDA
- Feature selection
- Modeling
- Fine tuning
- Model evaluation

Use f1 score as eval metrics and comment obtained results:
ex. What are risk factors? How well does the model work?
